# Linked Lists 101

Linked lists consist of nodes which contain data and a pointer to the next node. The end of the list is marked when the nodes pointer is _null_.

**Singly Linked Lists** - Only move in a single direction

**Doubly Linked Lists** - Can move both forward and back

**Circularly Linked Lists** - The last item's forward pointer goes to the first element and the first element's backward pointer goes to the last element.


## Common Linked list Operations:

1. Pop - Remove element from beginning of the list
2. Push - Add element to beginning of the list
3. Return - Print the values in the list
4. Search - Search for an element in the list
5. Delete - Delete an element within the list


## Notes

There are many many ways to do these implementations. I like to separate my class declarations and implementations into separate files. I think it promotes readability. If you want to put it all together that's cool too.
